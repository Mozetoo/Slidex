# üéõÔ∏è Slidex ‚Äì Multi-Screen Kinetic LED System

Slidex is a **complex, multi-structure kinetic LED display system** designed and built for a large-scale corporate event at **Grand Hyatt Dubai**.  
It brings together **custom electronics, real-time wireless communication, and a dynamic control application** to control multiple rotating LED screens with synchronized visuals.

## üìñ Overview

- **Structures:** Up to 5 vertical totems  
- **Screens:** 4 LED screens per structure  
- **Motion Control:** Each screen can rotate 360¬∞ and move vertically with precise distance control  
- **Communication:** Low-latency wireless control using ESP-NOW  
- **Software:** Fully dynamic Python + Qt application with scenario and video playback support

## üõ†Ô∏è My Role

I was responsible for the **complete electronic and software design** of Slidex:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Custom PCB Design
- Designed a robust ESP32-based control board using **EasyEDA**
- Selected components rated for high temperature and harsh environments
- Integrated **Ethernet** and **RS485** support
- Prototyped, validated, and tested every feature (power, comms, I/O)
